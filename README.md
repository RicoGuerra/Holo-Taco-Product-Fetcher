ðŸŒ®ðŸ’¿ **Holo there!** ðŸ’¿ðŸŒ®

This repository contains (at the moment) a rather simple script that fetches product information from Holo Taco's website and generates a comprehensive checklist in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) format. The checklist is organized by product lines, making it easy to see what you have and what you might still need to complete your collection.

1. Download this reopository the repository by clicking on **Code** in the upper right corner and then click **Download ZIP**. After the download finished, extract the files.  
2. Install Node.js
